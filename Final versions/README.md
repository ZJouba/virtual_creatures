# FINAL VERSIONS OF MOST IMPORTANT CODE FOR MASTERS THESIS
## SoftRoboticActuator-GeneticAlgorithm
This code generates soft robotic bending actuator designs that achieve a target actuator tip position or conform to a specified profile using curve fitting.

A genetic algorithm is used to optimise designs based on the chosen objective.

## SoftRoboticActuator-GrippingGeneticAlgorithm
This code generates soft robotic bending actuator designs that grip different objects using curve fitting.
