# Sharing an environment

You may want to share your environment with someone else---for example, so they can re-create a test that you have done. To allow them to quickly reproduce your environment, with all of its packages and versions, give them a copy of your environment.yml file.
Exporting the environment file

Note

If you already have an environment.yml file in your current directory, it will be overwritten during this task.


    Activate the environment to export:

            conda activate myenv

                    Note: Replace myenv with the name of the environment.

    Export your active environment to a new file:

            conda env export > environment.yml

                    Note: This file handles both the environment's pip packages and conda packages.

    Email or copy the exported environment.yml file to the other person.
